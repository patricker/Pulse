# Pulse

Pulse is an application that automatically changes your wallpaper (and so much more!) by downloading images from the Internet. You choose the search and filtering options, Pulse does all the heavy lifting to get you the wallpapers you want! Pulse works on Windows 7/8 and OSX with Mono (tested on 3.2.3, beta support).
